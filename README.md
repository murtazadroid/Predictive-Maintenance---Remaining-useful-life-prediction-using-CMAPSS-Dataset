# Predictive-Maintenance---Remaining-useful-life-prediction-using-CMAPSS-Dataset
This project aims to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of commercial aircraft engines, a critical aspect of aviation maintenance. The model we are developing has the potential to significantly streamline aircraft maintenance operations, thereby minimizing aircraft downtime.
